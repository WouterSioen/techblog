    This is a subject that occupies quite a lot of my thoughts as you can imagine. I can see where you are coming from when you say it's lazy but I think it's more about risk management.

    The sage on stage format is possibly the less risky format of all and that's why I think it is most prevalent. Organisers like myself have fairly predictable content. Employers know what their employees will get when they go, it's in the schedule and plain to see. For many delegates this meets their expectations as well. Other formats are more risky. Open space while the most engaging is a punt. The risk for the organiser, employer and attendee is quite high IMO.  How good will sessions be how coherent will the schedule or more simply what will I get for my money are some of the concerns.

    I think there is space in the middle though. I think a conference with a blend of sage's, open space, workshops, panels and debates your suggesting (which I really like BTW) could satisfy everyone's needs. It's getting the blend that's the tricky bit.

    Thanks for sharing this idea.

  content: I like this idea. Matt Wynne and I did something similar at ScotRUG a couple
    of years ago, http:&#47;&#47;scotrug.org&#47;2011&#47;01&#47;20&#47;january-meeting-do-mocks-suck-or-rock.html,
    and Kevin Rutherford organised a debate that I was involved in at the Scottish
    Ruby Conference in 2011.

  content: "This is a cool format that I think would be fun to try. \n\nI spoke at
    more conferences last year than I did this year largely because of the format
    issue you cite here. \n\nI feel like investing 45 or 60 minutes in lecturing to
    a room full of people is a large batch high-risk investment. I'd hate to think
    I bored a crowd for an hour. \n\nAnother potential solution is the lean coffee
    format (see here:http:&#47;&#47;contextdrivenagility.com&#47;2011&#47;08&#47;04&#47;seattle-lean-coffee-could-be-anywhere&#47;)
    \n\nA way to integrate this format into a conference session is to have a topic
    and a speaker prepared to talk about the subject and facilitate the lean coffee
    format. \n\nFor a 45 minute session I'd recommend the following approach: \n\nHand
    out sticky note pads and sharpies to attendees\n\n-5 minutes introducing the basic
    concept and foundations of the talk while attendees write down their questions&#47;interests
    on this subject. \n\n-5 minutes for attendees to stick their notes on an easel
    under the \"ready\" column and to give a brief summary what they mean on the sticky
    note. \n\n-1 minute for everyone to dot vote \n\n30 minutes of lean coffee style
    time-boxed discussion. \n\nThis format worked great at Seattle Kaizen Camp 2013
    and I'd love to see it tried in other conferences. \n\nGreat stuff, thanks for
    the post. :-)"

    I do think there's scope for differing formats than the 'traditional approach'. I'm just back from the Dublin Web Summit and they had a mix of fireside chats, the traditional approach, panels, pitches and demos.

    The diversity of format was really good for ensuring the sessions weren't getting stale. In particular I liked the fireside chats; two people, opposite&#47;conflicting views having a semi structured discussion.

    While my initial reaction to your proposal is that is sounds too structured I think the best thing to do would be to test it out. TechMeetup could be a perfect vehicle to test out different styles (like there recently was with the lightening talks).

<p>The traditional approach to running a tech conference is having a speaker talk at you for 40 minutes with a small time allotted for questions. I've heard conspiratorial grumbling that this leaves you feeling quite disengaged. But people aren't quite sure what to do about it.</p>
<p>Conference organisers have tried alternatives like unconferences, lightning talks or moving the whole conference to a resort. All quite interesting, but still not resolving the problem of creating a conference that engages the attendee.</p>
<p>Recently I attended a political conference. Political conferences also have sponsors, birds of a feather and keynotes. But they spend the majority of the day debating where they want to take their community next. When there is a diversity of opinion on an issue this creates an electrifying atmosphere, unlike any I've experienced elsewhere.</p>
<p>There is constant debate in our communities. Whether it's what Ruby testing framework to use this week or whether it's sacrificing another sacred cow of Agile. Instead of reflecting this debate we have one-sided conferences which don't express the spectrum of opinion on the latest issues.</p>

<h2>A debating format</h2>

<p>I would like to suggest that for part of a conference we use a debating format.</p>

<p>Conferences during the CFP ask for topics to debate. From this list a few key proposals will be chosen on subjects like "Are estimates harmful?". A champion must be chosen for both sides of the issue, followed by a second person to give additional perspective.</p>

<p>Given a 45 minute session:</p>

<ul>
<li>The announcer introduces the topic and asks the room what their current voting intention of the topic is</li>
<li>The champion for the subject has 7 minutes to make their point</li>
<li>The champion against the subject has 7 minutes to make their point</li>
<li>The seconder for the subject has 5 minutes</li>
<li>The seconder against the subject has 5 minutes</li>
<li>The champion for is given 3 minutes to sum up and respond</li>
<li>The champion against is given 3 minutes to sum up and respond</li>
<li>The announcer asks the audience to vote again and announces the outcome of the vote</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to scale up or down the number of speakers and time allotted to them.</p>

<p>These debates coould be encouraged to happen spontaneously if for example the keynote speaker says something controversial.</p>

<h2>So what do I want?</h2>

<p>I still think that we can enjoy and learn from the traditional classroom conference format. But I think we are rather lazy in the way that we rely on it so heavily. Let's get political.</p>
