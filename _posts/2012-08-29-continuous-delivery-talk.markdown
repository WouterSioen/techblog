How long does it take for your organisation to deploy a change that involves just a single line of code? It is no longer sufficient to rapidly create high quality software alone, the software has to be in production to start to realise its value. Continuous Delivery is a set of techniques inspired by the lean startup movement designed to drastically reduce the time and expense your software goes through during the “last mile”. In this talk I’ll present the principles and practices involved in Continuous Delivery focusing on the deployment pipleline, automated acceptance testing and the delivery ecosystem.
