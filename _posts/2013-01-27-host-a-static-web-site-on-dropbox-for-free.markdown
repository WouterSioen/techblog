<p>While at a local <a href="http://coderdojo.com/">CoderDojo</a> helping kids age 10-18 learn to program, I was asked how they could upload their work onto the Internet to show their parents. In this case it was html pages with css and images.</p>
<p>Assuming you already have a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/home">Dropbox</a> account:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a folder under your Public folder on Dropbox</li>
<li>Copy your web site files there</li>
<li>Log in to your Dropbox account online, navigate to the folder under Public</li>
<li>Find your starting html page (probably index.htm) in the Dropbox UI</li>
<li>Right click on the file and select "Copy Public Link"</li>
<li>Check out the link, share it with your friends</li>
</ol>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
