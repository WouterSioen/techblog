<p>I help people deliver software in a way that's understandable, testable, scalable, and correct.</p>
<p>In 2006, I joined JPMorgan to help their Investment Bank use agile practices to drive business more effectively and efficiently. In May 2010 I was selected to join their elite Expert Engineer program to focus on difficult problems seen within the bank.</p>
<p>I also blog at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.joejag.com">joejag.com</a> and, on occasion, speak at conferences about why developers should engage in "deliberate practice" to improve their skills.</p>
<p>In my career I've spent 7 years developing software for the finance, micro-biology and education sectors using many architectural styles. I have been creating web-based content, personally and professionally, since 1996.</p>
<p><b>Specialties</b><br />
Clean code, technical speaking, Java, Ruby, Linux administration and agile techniques.</p>
<p><b>Social Networks</b></p>
