<h2>Coding Dojo: Example Katas</h2></p>
<p>If you've came to this page directly, you might want to read my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.joejag.com&#47;2009&#47;the-coding-dojo&#47;">article on Coding Dojos</a>.  It also has a video of a presentation I gave at a local TechMeetup.</p>
<p>These are the problems I've set in my monthly Dojos.  They will usually be based on another existing example.  The main benefit of these here is that they are in a standard format.</p>
<h3>Bowling Scores</h3>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.joejag.com&#47;coding-dojo-bowling-scores&#47;">Full Specification</a></p>
<p>The goal of this program is to model a game of bowling. Given a series of input the program should output the players final score.</p>
<h3>Vending Machine</h3>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.joejag.com&#47;coding-dojo-vending-machine&#47;">Full Specification</a> [<a href="http:&#47;&#47;tech.puredanger.com&#47;2009&#47;05&#47;11&#47;best-language&#47;">Original</a>]</p>
<p>The goal of this program is to model a vending machine and the state it must maintain during it&rsquo;s operation.</p>
<h3>Converting numeral systems</h3>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.joejag.com&#47;coding-dojo-converting-between-different-numeral-systems&#47;">Full Specification</a></p>
<p>Converting between different numeral systems.  Urnfield and Roman numerals</p>
<h3>Test First Spreadsheet</h3>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.joejag.com&#47;coding-dojo-test-first-spreadsheet&#47;">Full Specification</a> [<a href="http:&#47;&#47;xp123.com&#47;xplor&#47;xp0201&#47;">Original</a>]</p>
<p>During this dojo we will be implementing a Spreadsheet from scratch.  We will start with the formula engine and write a GUI if there is time.</p>
<h3>Bank OCR</h3>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.joejag.com&#47;coding-dojo-bank-ocr&#47;">Full Specification</a> [<a href="http:&#47;&#47;codingdojo.org&#47;cgi-bin&#47;wiki.pl?KataBankOCR">Original</a>]</p>
<p>Your manager has recently purchased a machine that assists in reading letters and faxes sent in by branch offices.  The machine scans the paper documents, and produces a file with a number of entries. You will write a program to parse this file.</p>
